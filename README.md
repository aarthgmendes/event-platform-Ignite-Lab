# Plataforma de Eventos - Ignite Lab

This project was developed during the Ignite Lab, made by Rocketseat. In this application, the main language used was JavaScript with ReactJS as framework, along with GraphCMS and GraphQL using Apollo Client as API for requests. And to complement, the entire CSS part was developed using the TailWind CSS tool.
